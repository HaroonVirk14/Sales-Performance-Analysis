🚀  Sales Performance Analysis!📊  



I’m excited to share that I’ve successfully completed an in-depth analysis of Amazon sales data. Here's a breakdown of what I accomplished:



 🔍 Price Analysis

Calculated Key Metrics: Determined the average, median, and range for both discounted and actual prices.

Discount Insights: Identified products with the highest and lowest discounts to understand pricing strategies.



🌟 Rating Analysis

Visualized Ratings: Created a distribution plot of product ratings to gauge customer satisfaction.

Category Ratings: Calculated the average rating for each product category to identify top-rated categories.



 🛒 Category Analysis

Sales Performance: Summarized sales performance across different categories, including average and total discounted prices, and the number of products.

Category Insights: Highlighted top-performing and underperforming categories based on sales data and ratings.



 💸 Discount Analysis

Correlation Study: Analyzed the correlation between discount percentage and customer ratings.

Optimal Discounts: Determined the optimal discount ranges that maximize customer ratings and sales performance.



 📈 Tools and Techniques

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Converted price and discount data into numerical values and handled non-numeric rating values.

Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.

Aggregated Analysis: Employed Pandas for grouping and summarizing data.









This task not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also gave me valuable insights into sales and marketing strategies on e-commerce platforms. Looking forward to diving deeper into data and uncovering more insights in my upcoming tasks!
